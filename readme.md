# Laravel 5 Weather App:cloud: :umbrella:

This Laravel 5 application stores data in a  MongoDB database. The application consumes an API that provides weather forecast, uses temperature as a metric when supplied with name of a city then stores the data in the database

#Deployment.
To deploy, ** a dedicated Ubuntu 16 cloud server** is prefarable so that one can install individual features separately. This includes installing a fresh laravel installation to the server and also install mongodb separately on the same server. With "PHP atisan" database commands one can then create collections. To get the laravel files, a git pull to the apache server folder will do. One may need to edit the ".htaccess" file if some URLs are not working.

#Security measures

* The **"key:generate"**  artisan command should be used to generate a key for the app on first installation. This will help to encrypt all user sessions and other user data that may need encryption.

* As for **CSRF attacks**, each HTTP post request from a form is accompanied by a unique CSRF-Token generated by the application each time the form is generated. This will ensure that the user is protected from cross-site request attacks.

* **Middlewares** can be used on the app to filter HTTP requests especially whenever one wants to protect specific routes or specific users to access the system.
